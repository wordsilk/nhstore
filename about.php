define('TEXT_INFORMATION', '<p> We at New Headings have spent our lives outdoors, exploring the far-flung corners of our 
world. It\'s been both our passion and our profession. We know from experience that the right gear can make or break a trip, so our aim is to deliver a consultative, one-stop-shopping experience that helps every traveler get ready for his or her trip of a lifetime. We test and use everything we sell ourselves. Only if it works for us do we offer it to you. We live and love what we do, and our "Best Friends" join in our pursuits as often as possible!</p>
<h3>Mark LaMont</h3>
<p><img a class="bio" src="../../../images/MarkLamont.jpg" width="350" height="229" alt="Mark LaMont"/>Mark is driven by an appreciation for, and has dedicated himself to, a life spent in the Great Outdoors.  His 30+ years in the luxury travel industry led to his discovery of the "the anticipation event," that pre-departure period during which every traveler excitedly prepares for their trip, and so New Headings was born. His favorite new passion is that of helping and watching his beautiful wife, Peggy, evolve into an accomplished backcountry skier and triathlete!</p>
<h3>Peggy LaMont</h3>
<p><img a class="bio" src="../../../images/PeggyLamont.jpg" width="350" height="235" alt="Peggy LaMont"/>Peggy\'s warm, optimistic attitude combined with her 25+ years in customer service management make her a "New Headings Natural" - she is genuinely interested in helping every traveler prepare for their trip of a lifetime and believes she has the best title in the industry: "In Charge of Getting You Ready and Keeping You Comfortable." She looks forward to being your Personal Online Shopper and to discussing creative ways to commemorate your travels.</p>
<h3>Marcy LaMont</h3>
<p><img a class="bio" src="../../../images/MarcyLamont.jpg" width="350" height="235" alt="Marcy LaMont"/>  Marcy\'s adventurous spirit has made her a "Jack of Many Trades." She spent 18 years as a tour guide, running a diverse array of travel programs from helicopter hiking in the Bugaboos and Bobbie Burns of BC\'s Purcell Mountains to flora and fauna tours of Australia and New Zealand. Marcy happily joined her brother and Peggy at New Headings. She loves skiing, swimming, horse riding, theater, and doing anything with her husband, Jeff, and their dog, Biscuit.     </p>
