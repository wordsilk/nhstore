As per the arrangements with our bonded shippers, UPS and IBC Courier, a complete street address must be provided in order to facilitate proper shipping. Shipping and handling charges do include GST, VAT, or other similar import taxes or duties for shipments to non-USA addresses.<br><br>We neutralize the carbon footprint of your shipment by working with <i><b>Green Shipping</i></b> to purchase carbon offsets from Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF), a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing the supply and use of renewable energy. The BEF Carbon Offsets we purchase work to replace traditional sources of electricity with the development of clean and sustainable solar and wind power. BEF&acute;s Carbon Offsets meet rigorous environmental criteria and are Green-e&reg; Climate certified. Green-e is the nations leading independent consumer protection and certification program concerning the selling of carbon offsets to consumers.</p>
